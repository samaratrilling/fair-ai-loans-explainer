    <h2>What we do now</h2>
    <p>Currently, <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/post-election-audits635926066.aspx">43
        state—and Washington, DC</a>—require some type of post-election audit to ensure the accuracy of the initially
      reported tally. Of these states, the vast majority use a so-called "traditional" post-election audit. Typically,
      this means manually examining a specific percentage of the paper records produced by a ballot to ensure they match
      the counts produced by the voting system, which in many cases is electronic.

      Below, we have simulated a traditional post-election audit. This is a simulated election between red and green
      where there were 100 ballots cast. You can fiddle with both the margin of victory and the percentage of ballots
      you'd like to manually check. The yellow squares represent the ballots that were randomly chosen to audit. Play
      around with the sliders to see what happens in different scenarios.

    <p>Did you notice anything interesting? What happens if green wins in a landslide? Regardless of the margin of
      victory, <i>we always count the same number of votes</i> in a percentage-based audit. That's not very clever! When
      one
      side wins in a blow-out, election administrators are legally obligated to count every last ballot required by law.
      Imagine doing this for a large state, like the state of California. Even if green won by 99%, California counties
      would have to audit 1% of the total ballots cast. That’s over 130,000 ballots to examine by hand, if we use 2016
      turnout numbers (when 13.7 million ballots were cast).
