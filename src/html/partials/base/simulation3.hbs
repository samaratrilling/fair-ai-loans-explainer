    <h2>The Power of RLAs</h2>
    <p>Now that we’ve seen how different types of audit are conducted, it’s time to put them to the test. Here we’ll see
      the real power of risk-limiting audits. You’ll have three sliders at your disposal, giving you the ability to set
      the total number of votes cast, the margin of victory, and the percentage of votes to check for the traditional
      type of audit. Play around with the sliders. Do you notice anything interesting?

      Now, try moving the “total ballots cast” slider to the end (14 million). Next, move the margin of victory slider
      to 11%. Finally, move the traditional audit percentage to ‘3’. This represents the 2008 Presidential race in
      California, where Barack Obama won 61% of the 13.7 million votes cast. A risk-limiting audit would need to check
      just 97 ballots to have a high level of confidence in the result (a 90% chance of catching an error. Meanwhile,
      the current law would have required checking significantly more ballots.

    <p>
      How is this possible? The sequential probability ratio test is our secret weapon. As we saw before, with a
      traditional
      audit, we always count the same number of ballots. With SPRT, the greater the margin of victory, the fewer ballots
      we
      have to count to achieve a similar level of confidence in the result. <b>This is the true power of risk-limiting
        audits.</b> With significantly fewer ballots to check, election officials can spend their resources auditing
      other
      races farther down the ballot and upgrading voting equipment.
