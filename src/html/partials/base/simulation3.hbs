  <h2>The Power of RLAs</h2>
  <p>First, we've explored how a traditional post-election audit worked. Next, we the procedures behind risk-limiting audits. Now, it's time to put them head to head. Here's where we'll see the true power of risk-limiting audits.</p>

  <p>Below, we'll see how many ballots each approach will need to take. You'll be able to change two inputs: the number of votes cast in the contest and the margin of victory.</p>

  <div id="simulation-control">
    <label for="ballots-cast-slider">
      Number of ballots cast: <span id="ballots-cast-num">100</span>
    </label>
    <div id="ballots-cast-slider" class="nouislider-custom"></div>


    <label for="margin-of-victory">
      Margin of victory: <span id="margin-victory-num">9%</span>
    </label>
    <div id="margin-of-victory" class="nouislider-custom"></div>



    <label for="traditional-audit-percent">
      Percentage of ballots to audit (traditional): <span id="audit-percent-num">3%</span>
    </label>
    <div id="traditional-audit-percent" class="nouislider-custom"></div>

  </div>

    <h2>Number of ballots audited by traditional, fixed-percentage audit: <span id="traditional-number"></span></h2>
    <h2>Number of ballots audited by RLAs: <span id="rla-number"></span></h2>
